title: About the DevOps Dojo Consortium
---

The DevOps Dojo Consortium is collaboration of enterprise Dojos all seeking to improve both the outcomes of their companies and the
quality of life of product teams.

DevOps is often used to mean different things and many people new to DevOps instantly focus on what tools to buy. You cannot buy
DevOps and tools represent a small portion of the solution. In our context, this is guiding principle for DevOps

<blockquote>
DevOps should be defined by the outcomes. It is those sets of cultural norms and
technology practices that enable the fast flow of planned work from, among other
things, development through tests into operations, while preserving world class
reliability, operation, and security. DevOps is not about what you do, but what
your outcomes are. So many things that we associate with DevOps, such as
communication and culture, fit underneath this very broad umbrella of beliefs
and practices.<br><br>-- Gen Kim, 2014
</blockquote>

Each of the Dojos operate in their particular contexts with individualized implementation, but the overall goal is improving the
continuous flow of value to the end user with people collaborating with lean processes and heavy automation.
