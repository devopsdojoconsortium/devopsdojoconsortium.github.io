  "content": "Behavior Driven DevelopmentBehavior Driven Development acceptance criteria are the testable outcomes agreed upon by the team,including development, quality, and business that express the definition of done for a user story.Recommended PracticesAll tests follow the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern. Gherkin is a domain specific language that allows acceptance criteria to be expressed with this pattern in a way that is understandable to all stakeholders.Example:As an hourly associate I want to be able to log my arrival time so that I can be paid correctly.Given I am not clocked inWhen I enter my associate numberThen my arrival time will be loggedAnd I will be notified of the timeGiven I am clocked inWhen I enter my associate numberAnd I have been clocked in for more than 5 minutesThen I will be clocked outAnd I will be notified of the timeGiven I am clocked inWhen I enter my associate numberAnd I have been clocked in for less than 5 minutesThen I will receive an errorUsing Acceptance Criteria to Negotiate and SplitWith the above criteria, it may be acceptable to remove the time validation and accelerate delivery of the time logging ability. After delivery, the validation may not be required. If true, weve saved money and time by NOT delivering unneeded features.First we deliver the ability to clock in and see if we really do need the ability to verify.As an hourly associate I want to be able to log my arrival time so that I can be paid correctly.Given I am not clocked inWhen I enter my associate numberThen my arrival time will be loggedAnd I will be notified of the timeGiven I am clocked inWhen I enter my associate numberThen I will be clocked outAnd I will be notified of the timeIf, in production, we discover that the sanity check is required to prevent time clock issues, we can quickly add that behavior.As an hourly associate I want to be prevented from clocking out immediately after clocking in.Given I am clocked inAnd I have been clocked in for more than 5 minutesWhen I enter my associate numberThen I will be clocked outAnd I will be notified of the timeGiven I am clocked inAnd I have been clocked in for less than 5 minutesWhen I enter my associate numberThen I will receive an errorTips  Scenarios should be written from the point of view of the consumer.  Scenarios should be focused on a specific function and should not attempt to describe multiple behaviors.  If a story has more than 6 acceptance criteria, it can probably be split.  No acceptance test should contain more than 10 conditions. In fact, much less is recommended.ValueAs a development team, we want to know the specific behaviors that define done for a user story so that we can predict delivery with a high level of confidence.Acceptance Criteria  All stakeholders agree that the scenarios fully describe the deliverable.  The scenarios are testable.  The scenarios are declarative. They describe what the expected behavior is, but not how it will be implemented.  The scenarios avoid describing explicit UI activity unless it is critical to the outcomes.References  Gherkin Reference  BDD Process Information"

And how can we apply technology to drive business value?  For years, we&#39;ve been told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn&#39;t matter;  that it can&#39;t provide a competitive advantage to our companies.  Through four years of groundbreaking research, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and  Gene Kim set out to find a way to measure software delivery performanceand what drives  it, using rigorous statistical methods. This book presents both the findings and the  science behind that research. Readers will discover how to measure the performance of  their teams, and what capabilities they should invest in to drive higher performance.BDD in Action: by John Ferguson Smart  Manning Books  BDD in Action teaches you BDD principles and practices and shows you how to integrate them into your  existing development process, no matter what language you use.

  "content": "# {{ page.title }}## IntroductionOne of the most important coaching goals in a Dojo challenge is to inspire the team to understand the system view, specifically how value flows from ideation all the way to deployment and support. It isn&#39;t the &quot;First Way&quot; of DevOps for nothing. However, the question we often get sounds something like:&gt; Is it really necessary to train everyone regarding the overall system? Our developers need to be heads down and let the architects, RTE&#39;s, and other Program leaders manage the big picture.Of course as you read that question you can easily detect it resembles a defense of a well established management paradigm. Broaching this subject in your Dojo will require a healthy combination of some of these organizational attributes:* Understanding that DevOps is more than just pipeline tooling skills.* Sufficient framing and preparation with managers that the team will be empowered toward autonomy while entrusted to the Dojo.* Trust that the Dojo coaches are working toward the good of all, not just the team members.* Openness that despite how teams are currently aligned, that teams can contribute realignment insights to improve feature lead times. * A catching on of the fact that software architecture is a skill vs being a role.Even heavily matrixed organizations mired in a negative cycle of pointing people&#39;s attention back toward their siloed constraints are coming around to the realization that they must at least make the Value Stream visible in some way. We beleive the Dojo can demonstrate value to both the team and the programs they serve by establishing a Value Stream orientation in the early stages of the engagement. We map the value stream early on. We call out dependencies. We reduce handoffs where empowered. We report on the waste in handoffs where not empowered. In all this, we see time and time again that Value Stream orientation in the Dojo creates retained value for the team and creates viral value for other programs in the organization watching all this transpire.

  "content": "# {{ page.title }}The purpose of Value Stream Mapping Workshop is to understand all of the steps needed todeliver value from conception to production. We can then use it as a tool toidentify constraints and propose improvements to the value stream.## Recommended Practices1. Everyone who has a touch point in the value stream should be present for the   exercise. This includes, but is not limited to, the developers, the   engineering manager, the product owner, and representatives from any external   teams that have required steps between idea and production.2. Start with an introduction to what value stream mapping is, and why it is important.### Explain the terms associated with value stream mapping- Build Cycle Time: Total duration of the build, from commit to deploy.- Development Cycle Time: The time from when work begins until it is deployed to production. Done.- Lead Time: The time taken from start to end of the value stream.- Process Time / Value Add Time: The time spent executing a particular process.- Wait Time / Non-value Time: The time between processes where no activity is occurring.- Percent Complete and Accurate: The percentage of work from a process that is   rejected by the next process. If coding fails code review 20% of the time,   it&#39;s %C/A is 80%.### Identify source of request*Example:* Refine EpicFor each source of _Requests_  1. What is the outcome of that step, or next step?  2. Who is involved in that step?  3. How long does this step take?  4. How long between the previous and current steps?### Identify Rework Loops for each step1. To which steps do we return to from this one for corrections?2. How often is work rejected from this step (percentage complete and accurate)?### Identify value added time, cycle time, and lead time1. What is the total value time (time spent doing work) from conception to production?2. What is the total non-value time (time waiting) from conception to production?## Outcomes- Visual representation of the value stream(s) of the team.- Identify possible constraints to flow based on value added time, cycle time, and lead time.## Sample Workshop AgendaThe below sample is for a 3 day workshop that focuses more on the flow of work and less on the numbers.  If you would like to go into more of the metrics extending the workshop to 5 days would allow for that.#### Day 1- Workshop working agreements- Review of workshop charter- Create/interate through current state value stream map#### Day 2- Refine Value Stream Map and add data points- Identify waste and oppotunities to improve the flow of work- Start future state value stream map#### Day 3- Complete future state value stream map- Document/prioritize Kiazen improvement opportunities## Tips- Involve all team members associated to any part of the process of getting value from conception to production.- Review and maintain value stream map to show wins associated to implementing improvement.- Take into account all potential flows for team processes, and value stream those as well.## ValueAs a team, we want to understand how to value stream map our team processes, so that we may understand bottlenecks associated to delivering value, and identify areas of improvement.## Acceptance Criteria- Value stream all things associated to delivering value.- Create action items of improvement from exercise.## References- [Value Stream Mapping Guide](https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/value-stream-mapping-guide/)- [Value Stream Mapping: How to Visualize Work and Align Leadership for Organizational Transformation](https://books.google.com/books/about/Value_Stream_Mapping_How_to_Visualize_Wo.html?id=MeFrAAAAQBAJ)"

  "content": "So, you hired an Agile Transformation consulting company to advise executive leadership and youre Agile now. Leadership attended a week-long class on Agile, teams took a two day class about Scrum being The Way. The new methodology with story points, daily standup, and sprints now reigns, but outcomes havent changed. Next, you talk about the agile mindset while Scrum Masters report monthly on how much velocity has increased. At the team level, the labels have changed, but the processes are the same. Possibly there is less design, but you dont design solutions in Agile. They just emerge, right?What went wrong? Marketing and the desire for silver bullets overtook goals and outcomes. You saw a framework that was popular and bought it without understanding the underlying principles. However, frameworks are solutions that worked for someone else in their context, not yours, and no drive-by transformation will result in anything except loss revenue, frustration, and low satisfaction from both customers and employees. For real change to happen, it needs to be ingrained into the culture. Culture and mindset change requires behavior change. At the team level, we do this with constructive constraints and rapid feedback.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.Principles of Agile DevelopmentTheres our goal: the continuous delivery of valuable software is our highest priority. Thats the outcome we are after, continuous delivery; CI/CD. We can measure that outcome, apply the correct constraints, and move the culture.Not BuzzwordsContinuous integration and continuous delivery have measurable outcomes, they arent buzzwords. I often hear people use CI/CD when they mean build tool automation and dont even get me started on DevOps.  Weve created a DevOps team to implement CI/CD pipelines and manage the releases. Were DevOps now!How many of you just cringed?Continuous integration is behavior, not Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis, or any other tool. CI is how we apply these tools and CI is the key to transforming teams. However, to be effective, we need to be explicit about CI definitions and how we measure our ability to execute.Ubiquitous Language  Each developer submits tested, backwards compatible changes that are Integrated to the trunk daily.This definition creates constructive constraints and rapidly uncovers cultural, technical, and process challenges. Asking continuously, why cant we do this? drives the improvement conversation. The common challenges are basic but take discipline to solve.  Workflow isnt managed correctly with too many things in progress, lack of prioritization, and lack of teamwork to drive things to completion.  Work hasnt been refined to the detail required to deliver it.  Testing is manual, requires handoffs to a testing team, or just doesnt exist.All of these impact quality and delivery speed. To fix them, we start with some simple improvements.Establish PoliciesExplicit policies are important for keeping everyone aligned. Keep them concise, clear, and always visible. Policies stored on a file share do not exist. Print them and post them.CI Working AgreementA working agreement focused on CI highlights the real priority, sustainable delivery of decreasing batch size with high quality and rapid development feedback.  Fixing a broken build is the teams highest priority because we cannot fix production with a broken build.  The team will not go home while the build is broken because it puts production at risk.  We do not blame team members for broken builds. The team is responsible for hardening the build process against breaks so the team broke the build.  All branches originate from the trunk and are deleted in less than 24 hours  All changes must include all relevant tests and may not break existing tests  Changes are not required to be feature completeHelping the team complete work in progress is more important than starting new work  No work may begin before it meets our definition of readyThis will not happen on day one. The team should be asking daily, whats the main reason we cannot do this? and apply fixes until they can.Definition of ReadyFor any step, there must be exit criteria to prevent rejection from downstream steps. For refining work, it must be clear enough to prevent questions, guessing about what requirements mean, or gold plating during development.  Acceptance criteria aligned with the value are agreed to and understood by the team and business  Dependencies documented and solutions in place to allow delivery without them  Any required research / training is complete  Interface contract changes documented  Component functional tests definedWith these policies in place, the team can begin removing other roadblocks.Visualize MetricsUntil you know where you are, you cannot chart a path. Metrics are meaningless unless they are always visible. We use Hygieia to monitor CI outcomes, before that, we built Graphana views. No matter what method you choose, current metrics must be kept visible to everyone.  How frequently are pull requests integrating to Master?  Whats the average branch age?  How long does it take to fix broken builds?  How stable is the build?  Is the build taking too long?  How many tests are running and is that number increasing?Track them, gamify them, make them better, and understand the goal is continuous improvement. Metrics are indicators, not goals.Clear ImpedimentsNow the real work of changing habits begins. Habits change when previous habits no longer deliver value. When there is no pressure to integrate more frequently, re-refining work in progress doesnt cause much pain. Integrating code once a week or longer with multi-hour code reviews and regular merge conflicts seem normal and acceptable. With our new drive to deliver code to the trunk daily, things must change.Improve RefiningImproperly refined work has cascading impacts on quality outcomes. If work isnt refined to the level of testable acceptance criteria, then there are too many uncertainties and delivery pressure results in guesswork during development. This impact proper testing since poorly refined work drives developers into a constant proof of concept mindset with exploratory coding as the primary flow. Its very common to see retry loops in a value stream map after development has started where developers are waiting on clarification. This, in turn, incentivizes increased WIP as they pick up new work while they wait and additional delivery delays as they context switch back or just park the original work until he lower priority WIP is completed.Behavior Driven Development is an important tool for changing the culture and improving outcomes. BDD focuses on collaborating with all stakeholders to uncover the real business needs. Outcomes are owned by all of the stakeholders, not just the developers. We dont finger point, we problem solve and focus on improvement. We also learn together that wed rather fail small.  Simplicity  the art of maximizing the amount of work not done  is essential.Principles of Agile DevelopmentBDD gives us declarative, unambiguous acceptance criteria that can be tested. Now we have feature level functional tests that decompose into component level functional tests easily identifiable contract changes. We have a much higher level of confidence for what the business wants because they helped us define it and own the outcomes. We also know what NOT to develop since anything we develop beyond what we agreed to is a defect.With a hard definition of done and clear delivery goals, we can easily swarm the work as a team. Which services will be impacted? Will new services be required? How can we collaborate to deliver those changes as a team?Improve Testing ProcessCI/CD is a quality process, not build automation. In a previous 5 Minute DevOps, I spoke about the layers of tests required to execute CI/CD correctly. To add to that, two quotes from one of my favorite books.  Its interesting to note that having automated tests primarily created and maintained either by QA or an outsourced party is not correlated with IT performance. Automated unit and acceptance tests should be run against every commit to version control to give developers fast feedback on their changes. Developers should be able to run all automated tests on their workstations in order to triage and fix defects.Excerpts From: Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble &amp;amp; Gene Kim. Accelerate.Real CI requires that testing primarily happens before code commit. It also means that manual testing and/or handoffs to a testing team will break us. We cannot meet our goals that way. Habits must change.  Since the team defined how the feature will work to a testable level during refining, all thats required is to implement the tests. Instead of struggling to come up with what to test, developers can spend time designing HOW to most efficiently test against the goal. This results in more downstream improvement.  Code reviews improve. There is no need to code review for functionality, thats what tests are for. Code review can focus on readability and verifying that the tests match what was agreed to as a team. The tests validate the new functionality and protect that behavior on every subsequent build. As we reduce the time between merges, changes are smaller and code review is more effective and can be completed in minutes instead of hours.  The increased confidence that we can make change without breaking existing features makes development faster. We sleep better at night because we know we can triage and fix things faster at 3:00 am without risking breaking things even more.  Test suites are less likely to become spaghetti code because we need our tests to run quickly. Test code is code and requires constant design and refactoring. The need for rapid test results helps this happen. Michael Nygard once told me that he created a test that would fail the test suite if it ran for longer than 15 minutes to force refactoring of the tests. Brilliant.Workflow Management  Individuals dont win in business, teams do.Sam WaltonImagine a football team where everyone was measured only by how often they scored. Everyone will be focused on getting the ball, scoring, and being a hero instead of helping the teammate who has the ball. The same happens on a development team.Have you seen a team where everyone has assigned tasks instead of pulling work or where individuals are measured based on how many tasks they complete? With everyone focused on their task list or making themselves appear to be heroes, they arent focused on helping to deliver the next value item. Youll see this in long wait times on pull requests, cherry-picking low priority, easy to complete work or increased work in progress. They look busy, but value delivery is minimal.The teamwork expectations and time box constraints in the CI working agreement along with leadership understanding how to incentivize better outcomes result in lower lead time and increased throughput. The team only looks less busy.Only Outcomes Matter  Working software is the primary measure of progress.Principles of Agile DevelopmentThe customers only care about how quickly they can see value from the next feature. As development leaders, the goal is to help the teams find better ways to deliver value and to align the process in ways that encourage this. CI is an effective way to do this if the correct policies are in place. It provides easily measurable outcomes that allow rapid feedback for any improvement experiment. Because of the level of teamwork required to execute at a high level, its also an effective way for a new team to more quickly evolve from forming to performing. Weve witnessed this repeatedly.One note to this: Teams grow and learn as organisms. Team members are not legos. Adding or removing anyone from a team reduces the teams effectiveness. Team change should be done carefully and infrequently unless improved outcomes isnt a goal.ExcusesSome may assert that CI works quite well using an integration branch or GitFlow, that integrating every week or once a sprint is fine, or that only complete work should be integrated, Ive heard all of those excuses before. Ive also failed that way. Real CI drives real results. Culture changes because the underlying behaviors change. The reverse is never true. Dont allow lack of knowledge, lack of testing, or fear prevent improvement.Fix the problems.This post originally appeared on Medium. You can see other posts in the 5 Minute DevOps series there"

  "content": "We are creating an innovative environment and a strong corporate culture, and that is living the dream.You dont have to be a genius or a visionary or even a college graduate to be successful. You just need a framework and a dream. Michael DellThe Society for Human Resource Managements 2017 Employee Job Satisfaction Survey stated that only 41% of respondents were extremely satisfied with the work itself. Unfortunately, this is not living the dream. If people are going into the office everyday feeling uninspired about their work, then this is an opportunity for innovation. The great news is that we can create a better work environment for everyone. It starts with creating a continuous improvement culture, and this empowers teams to optimize their processes. What does optimizing processes include? It includes many things, but some of the activities are streamlining, eliminating, and automating processes. If we reduce the time that our teams spend on manual work, then they have time to work on innovative ideas that can often drive revenue. Innovation increases the companys bottom line, so the organization wins. Also, this work is typically more exciting, so our colleagues win. It creates happier teams, and the company creates a solid competitive advantage due to the increased long term business value.Creating a continuous improvement culture starts with a mind shift change, so everyone starts thinking about the ways they want to improve processes. Also, it helps to have a strategy, so the teams know how to get started with their first continuous improvement project. In addition, it is a good idea to have someone coaching the team that has had previous experience in the continuous improvement space.There are 3 high level components to a continuous improvement project:-A goal -A framework-Metrics that will help you measure your successFirst, the goal defines the dream. It answers the question of why we are doing the project. An expected outcome could be to reduce the time or cost of a process. Also, you may want to increase the quality or employee satisfaction that occurs while completing the process. A bonus would be to create value for all 4 areas. Also, a good practice is to define the goal in business terms, because it  helps everyone understand what we want to do. For example, I want to take Process A from 10 days to 5 days for an estimated 50% cost reduction.Next, using the correct framework will make the process innovation a success. Value stream mapping and A3 are 2 common frameworks, and they break down the steps of the process improvement project. The value stream mapping framework creates a visual representation of the steps of the process, and it helps to identify the issues. Similarly, the A3 framework captures the steps of the process, so the team is able to find any challenges. Next, the team analyzes the root cause of the issues, so they can be resolved.Third, collecting the metrics will help the teams make data driven decisions, and it will help them report their business value creation. The current state of the process will create the baseline metrics for time, cost, quality, and employee satisfaction. After the baseline data is collected, then the teams will want to collect the data for the future state of the process. This will let them measure the impact they are creating by executing the continuous improvement work. If the measured impact is low, then they may need to determine a new method for achieving their goals. Also, they could decide to classify the work at a lower priority, so they are able to expedite the execution of more impactful work. On the other hand, if the work has a high impact, then they will classify it at a high priority. After the process innovations have been executed, then the team will collect the new data to report the actual business value creation.In conclusion, we spend a large amount of time working, and we take pride in being top performers. A week has 168 hours total, so working 50 hours is almost 1/3 of the total time available. There are many opportunities to optimize our time at work with a continuous improvement projects. The starting point for a continuous improvement project is having a goal, a framework, and metrics to make data driven decisions and measure success. We will be creating more business value with the available time, and this increases job satisfaction. It will lead to things like increased morale, reduced turnover, and it will help with recruiting top talent. Most importantly, we are creating an innovative environment and a strong corporate culture, and that is living the dream.This post orginally appeared on https://technologyandoptimizingprocesses.com."

  "content": "I was asked recently about the best practice for using GitFlow with continuous integration. For those who do not know, this is GitFlow:There is no CI good practice that includes GitFlow. For continuous integration to meet the definition, these are the good practices:  Developers must implement all tests before they commit code. This is a non-negotiable and I will not work with developers who refuse to test. Professionals deliver working, tested code. Script kiddies dont test.  Use CI automation to trigger builds for every pull request so that bad changes can be rejected before code review.  Ensure that all tests are executed and linting and static code analysis is done for every PR.  Implement CI practices:          All developers branch from the trunk, make changes, and submit PRs back to trunk.      The branches are removed in less than 24 hours.      Youre now doing Trunk Based Development. Welcome to your CI/CD journey!The complexity of the CI automation will depend on how poorly the application is architected and the size of the development team. Monoliths with poor sub-domain boundaries will require much more complicated test design and test execution will take much longer. Evolve The architecture into independent, loosely coupled sub-domains to improve delivery speed, reduce testing overhead, and improve stability, resilience, and scalability.GitFlow does not increase quality or value delivery. It delays quality signal feedback to the developers, incentivizes manual process, and is incredibly wasteful of time and resources. No modern development uses it.Some developers have a religion built around GitFlow because it reduces typing (reduced pain from not testing) and they dont track their levels of re-work, lost changes, or conflict resolution. In 2010, GitFlow felt good. We could keep Master clean. That was almost a decade ago. Testing was still mostly manual. We were still on Java 6. NodeJS was barely a thing. Time to modernize. We dont keep Master clean with process. We keep it clean with automation.Other examples:  The Amazing DevOps Transformation Of The HP LaserJet Firmware Team  What is Continuous Delivery?This post orginally appeared on Medium.
